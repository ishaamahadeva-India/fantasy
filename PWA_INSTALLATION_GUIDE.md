3. Click "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app will be installed and can be launched like a native app

#### **On Android:**
1. Visit `https://www.quizzbuzz.in` in Chrome
2. A banner will appear at the bottom: **"Add quizzbuzz to Home screen"**
3. Tap "Add" or "Install"

### What's Configured:

✅ **Service Worker** (`sw.js`) - Enables offline functionality

✅ **Favicon** - Browser tab icon  
✅ **Apple Touch Icon** - iOS home screen icon  
✅ **Theme Colors** - Brand colors (#E6C87A)  
✅ **Standalone Display** - App opens without browser UI  

### Requirements for PWA Installation:

1. **HTTPS** - ✅ Your site uses HTTPS (required for PWA)
2. **Manifest File** - ✅ Configured at `/manifest.json`
3. **Service Worker** - ✅ Generated by `next-pwa`
4. **Icons** - ✅ All icon sizes present
5. **Valid Icons** - ✅ Fixed (no longer corrupted)

### Browser Support:

- ✅ **Chrome/Edge** - Full support
- ✅ **Safari (iOS 11.3+)** - Full support
- ✅ **Firefox** - Full support
- ✅ **Samsung Internet** - Full support

### Testing Installation:

1. **Desktop**: Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest → Check "Add to homescreen"
2. **Mobile**: Use Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS
3. **Lighthouse**: Run Lighthouse audit → Should show "Installable" badge

### What Happens After Installation:

- App opens in **standalone mode** (no browser UI)
- Works **offline** (cached pages)
- Can be **launched from home screen**
- **Fast loading** (service worker caching)
- **App-like experience**

### Troubleshooting:

If install prompt doesn't appear:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Ensure you're on HTTPS
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify manifest.json is accessible at `/manifest.json`
5. Check that service worker is registered (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)
